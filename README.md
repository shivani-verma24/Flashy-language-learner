# Flashy-language-learner
Flashy language learner is an application in python using tkinter. It allows the user to learn french words and guess their english meaning. If the user knows the meaning, then the word gets removed from the data file and only those words appear which are yet to learn. It is great project to help user learn new language in an exciting way.
